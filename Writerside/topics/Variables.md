# Variables
There are no special keyword to declare an immutable variable:
```Scala
x = 1 // no val or let
x inc echo 
```


But there is "mut" for mutable
```Scala
mut answer = 31
answer <- 42 // since = already taken u mutate with <-
// <- also makes mutations more noticeable

```
Explicit type declaration:
```Scala
name::String = "Alice"
```
