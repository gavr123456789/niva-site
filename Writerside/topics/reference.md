# Niva
///
It will be Smalltalk like language, but statically typed.
Niva targets JVM, and provides easy way to call any Java\Kotlin code.  
On an imaginary graph of complexity, I would put a field here:  
Go < Niva < Java < Kotlin < Scala

Niva is strongly inspired by the forgotten Smalltalk language  

![smalltalk rules.png](smalltalk rules.png)

Niva combines some OOP and functional properties  
  
OOP  
There are no functions, everything is method, in other words there is always a receiver

Functional  
There are no inheritance or interfaces. Instead, tagged unions are heavily utilized.  
This greatly reduces dynamism, the code is easier to understand because you always know which specific method will be called.

Almost everything in niva is a message send to object, for example there are no while loop or if syntax.
(Thanks to the inline, this does not create additional overhead costs)

## Backend
Current backend is Kotlin, because you get 4 backends for free - JVM, Native, JS, Wasm, also ecosystem is rich.
A lot of pet-project languages are translated into js, which is very high-level, so why not be translated into a real language.

## Name
I haven't decided on the final name yet, so far I've chosen niva because my 2 favorite static languages are nim and vala.

## Compile from sources
P.S. u can find binary releases in the releases  
After running compile.sh you will get niva_compiler folder that contains jvm or native binary.

### JVM
1) `sh compile.sh jvm`
2) run compiler from bin folder
### Native
1) install graalvm `yay -S jdk21-graalvm-bin` and set it default: `sudo archlinux-java set java-21-graalvm` on Arch, `nix shell nixpkgs#graalvm-ce` on nix
2) `sh compile.sh bin`
### Usage

Niva can eat .niva and .scala files, because Scala highlight fits well for Niva :3
`niva main.niva` - compile and run  
`niva main.niva -с` - compile only, will create binary for native target and fat-jar for jvm
`niva main.niva -i > info.md` - will generate info about all code base of the projects, `-iu` - only user defined files
`niva run` - run all files in current folder with main.niva as entry point
`niva build` - produce binary

# Core

Almost everything in this lang is message send(function call), because of that there are 3 ways of doing it(don't worry, none of them requires parentheses).

#### Hello world
Everything is sending a message to an object.
There no such things as `function(arg)`, only `object message`
```Scala
"Hello world" echo // print is a message for String
```
You can send as many messages as you want
```Scala
"12.08.2009" asDate days echo 
// 12
```

Okay, but what if the message has some arguments?  
Just separate them with colons, this is called a keyword message:
```Scala
obj message: argument

1 to: 5 // oh, we just created nice range syntax
```
And what about many arguments?  
Easy
```Scala
1 to: 5 do: [ it echo ] // 1 2 3 4 5
```
aand we don't need things like hardcoded for/while/do_while loops in language anymore, the second argument here is a code block.

Here some more examples:
```Scala
5 factorial //unary 
5 + 5       // binary (only math symbols allowed)
map at: "key" put: "value" // keyword
```

#### Type and methods declaration
Niva is statically typed language, so we need a way to declare custom types, here it is, just the syntax of keyword messages with type keyword.

Each type automatically has a constructor that represents as the same keyword message, isn't it beautiful?
```Scala
// Declare type Person with 2 fields
type Person name: String age: Int
// Instantiation
person = Person name: "Bob" age: 42
```
To declare method for type just type `Type function_signature = body`
```Scala
// unary method declaration for Person receiver
Person sleep = [...]
// method call
person sleep
// with arguments(keyword message)
TimeInterval from: x::Date to: y::Date = [ 
  // using x and y
]
```


In the last example you can see a problem, we don't need local names for from and to.
Because of that there are another way to declare keyword message:
```Scala
Random from::Int to::Int = ... // `from` and `to` are local arguments
```

All methods are extension methods(like in Kotlin or Scala), so you can add new methods for default types like `Int`
You can also define many methods at once
```Scala
extend Int [
    unary1 = []
    unary2 = []
]

// instead of
Int unary1 = []
Int unary2 = []
```

## Control flow

## Messages
```Scala
1 < 2 ifTrue: ["yes!" echo]
1 > 2 ifFalse: ["no!" echo]
// `ifTrue:ifFalse:` is single message with 2 arguments
1 > 2 ifTrue: [...] ifFalse: [...]
// ifTrue:ifFalse: can be used as expression
x = 42 < 69 ifTrue: [1] ifFalse: [0] // x == 1

// Loops
{1 2 3} forEach: [it echo] // 1 2 3
1..3
```



## Syntax

### If
```Scala
// single expression
1 < 2 => "yes!" echo
// with body
1 < 2 => [
  ...
]
// with else
1 > 2 => "yes" echo |=> "no" echo
// as expression
x = 1 > 2 => "yes" |=> "no" // x == "no"
```
### Switch
```Scala
// multiline switch
x = 1
| x
| 1 => "switch 1" echo
| 2 => "switch 2" echo
|=> "what?" echo

// single line switch
m = |x| 1 => x inc | 2 => x dec |=> 0
// m == 2 because of x inc
```
### If Elif Else chain
You can think of that as pattern matching on true(`_`) the first expression that matches will evaluate then expression.
The ball of execution flow seems to fall from above along the flow of execution onto this stick, and rolls out of one of the conditions

```Scala
// multiline
_
| x > 5 => 1  // if
| x > 4 => 2  // elif
| x < 4 => 3  // else
|=> 0

single line
y = _| x > 5 => 1 |=> 2
```


#### Program example: Factorial
`factorial` is a message for `Int` type, that returns `Int`.
`self` is context-dependent variable that represents Int on which factorial is called.
The whole function is one expression, we pattern matching on self with `|` operator that acts as switch expression here.
```Scala
// switching on this(Int receiver)
Int factorial -> Int = | this
| 0 => 1
|=> (this - 1) factorial * this

5 factorial echo
```

#### Fibonacci
```Scala
//
Int fib -> Int = _
| this < 2 => 1
|=> (this - 2) fib + (this - 1) fib

5 fib echo
```

#### Is even
```Scala
Int isEven = [
  | self % 2 == 0 => true
  |=> false
]

5 isEven echo
4 isEven echo
```

#### Function call
There 3 types
```Scala
5 factorial //unary 
5 + 5       // binary (only math symbols allowed)
map at: "key" put: "value" // keyword
```

## Message cascading [Need design]
This feature is directly from smalltalk. It's the same as [Clojure doto](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doto) or [Pascal With Do](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/refsu62.html) or [Kotlin with](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/with.html), many langs has something like that:
`;` is cascade operator, that mean the message will be sent to the first receiver, not to the result of the previous one
```Scala
c = {}. // empty list
c add: 1; add: 2; add: 3
```
is the same as
```Scala
c = {}.
c add: 1
c add: 2
c add: 3
```
That is, imagine that you have an add function that takes 2 numbers and returns their sum
C lang
```C
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
If you chain functions like this
```C
add(1, add(2, add(3, 4)))
```
you will get 1 + 2 + 3 + 4  
and if you want to apply all functions to the same value you will need:
```C
int a = 0;
a = add(3, 4);
a = add(a, 2);
a = add(a, 1);
``` 
Lest imagine its Java, and int itself has added method then:
```C
int a = 0;
a = a.add(1).add(2).add(3).add(4);
```
will give you 1, because each call after `add(1)` was applied to the result of the previous call, and not to the original variable a.  
So to get fluent design in Java like languages you need to return this or new instance of this on each method.

So the same on niva will look like:
```Scala
Int add: b -> Int = [ 
  self + b 
]
a = 0 add: 1; add: 2; add: 3; add 4 // 10
```
This is very convenient for chaining any calls. Since setting field values is also a message, you can do this:
```Scala
person = Person name: "Alice" age: 42
person name: "Bob"; age: 43 // send message name and age to person

boxWidget = Box width: 40 height: 50
boxWidget 
  add: Label text: "hello"; 
  add: Button text: "press me";
  height: 100;
```

## Code blocks

You can create code block like this:
```Scala
block = ["hello from block" print]
```
To evaluate block send value message to it:
```Scala
block value // hello from block printed
```
Block with arguments:
```Scala
block::[Int -> Int] = [x -> x + 1]
block value: 1 // 2
```
Many args -> many value messages:
```Scala
block::[Int, Int, Int -> Int] = [x y z-> x + y + z]
block value: 1 value: 2 value: 3 // 6
```
If you have a better ideas how to send many arguments to blocks please make an issue.
I have another variant in mind with named args
```Scala
block::[Int -> Int] = [it + 1]
block it: 1 // 2

block x: 1 y: 2 z: 3 // 6

```


# Tagged unions
Declaration:
```C
union Shape area: Int =
| Rectangle => width: Int height: Int
| Circle    => radius: Int

rectangle = Rectangle area: 42 width: 7 height: 6

rectangle area echo
rectangle width echo
rectangle height echo
```
Both Rectangle and Circle has area field.
Every branch is usual type, so you can create them separately.
```Scala
Rectangle area: 42 width: 7 height: 6
```
Every branch here has an area field.

## Built-in collection literals

I almost stole Rich Hickey's syntax, I hope he won't be offended `^_^`
```Scala
listLiteral = 
  | "{" spaces "}" -- emptyList
  | "{" listElements "}" -- notEmptyList
listElements = primary whiteSpaces (","? spaces primary)*

hashSetLiteral = 
  | "#{" spaces "}" -- emptyHashSet
  | "#{" listElements "}" -- notEmptyHashSet
```
As you can see from that grammar, commas between elements are optional.

## List
```Scala
list = {1 2 3 4}
list add: 5  //! {1 2 3 4 5}
list at: 0   //! 1
list copy at: 0 put: 5 //! {5 2 3 4 5}
list //! {1 2 3 4 5}
```
## Map
```Scala
x = #{"sas" 1, "sus" 2}
x at: "ses" put: 3
```
## Set
```Rust
set = #{1 2 3}
set add: 2 //! #{1 2 3}
set add: 4 //! #{1 2 3 4}
set has: 3 //! true
```
